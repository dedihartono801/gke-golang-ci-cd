# GKE Golang CI/CD Example

This repository contains an example Golang application with CI/CD integration for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate a basic setup for building and deploying a Golang application on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) using CI/CD pipelines. The example includes:

- A simple Golang application.
- Dockerfile for containerization.
- Kubernetes manifests for deployment on GKE.
- CI/CD pipelines configured with GitHub Actions.

## here are some fundamental things that I have learned and implemented in Google Kuberentes Engine:

1. CI/CD integration for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with Github Action
2. Deployment (to manage and control the rollout of application instances or pods)
3. Node Selector
4. Service (Cluster IP, Node Port and Load Balancer)
5. Ingress with SSL
6. HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)
7. PDB (Pod Disruption Budget)
8. Node Auto Scaller
